## Problem Statement

In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, making the most of revenue is essential for long-term sucess and driver happiness. Our goal is to use data-driven insights to maximise revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need. Our research aims to determine whether have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type and fare amount.

## Objective

This project's main goal to run an A/b test to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment . We use Python hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to extract useful information that can help taxi drivers generate more cash. In particular, we want to find out if there is a big difference in the fares for those who pay with credit cards versus those who pay with cash.

## Research Question

Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type and car we nudge customers towards payment method that generate higher revenue for drivers,without negatively impacting experience?
